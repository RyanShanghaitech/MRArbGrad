4.2.0 (Jan 29, 2026)
Add interface to set gradient buffer and trajectory buffer.

4.1.1 (Jan 26, 2026)
Fix bugs in save/load F64/F32().

4.1.0 (Jan 26, 2026)
Add loadF64() and loadF32() interface.

4.0.0 (Jan 22, 2026)
Remove `nAcq` in the real-time trajectory interface as it no longer needed.

3.1.0 (Jan 17, 2026)
Move most memory allocation to constrcutor. Add Yarnball_RT,

3.0.1 (Jan 8, 2026)
Fix API inconsistency between Python and C-API, and fix bug that interpolation is not performed in Python interface.

3.0.0 (Jan 8, 2026)
Delete `is3D` parameter - it's useless and confusing now in practice. We also rename `VarDenSpiral` to `VDSpiral` to make the naming more concise.

2.1.1 (Jan 8, 2026)
move all typedef to global.h.

2.1.0 (Jan 4, 2026)
add a helper function `gradClip()`.

2.0.0 (Jan 3, 2026)
We do not support `getNWait()` and `getNSamp()` in the C++ layer anymore, which previously accounted for the samples to wait before the ADC window and the length of the ADC window in samples, as sometimes gradient waveform may contain ramp-up and ramp-down. We decide to leave ramping in sequence design stage outside of this package's scope. So that we can make this package concise.

Instead, we add `getMaxNSamp()` interface in `MrTraj()` class, as pulse programmer needs this to decide the TR.

We also plan to drop out `bMaxG0` and `bMaxG1` in `GradPara` interface. These parameters are used to let users choose whether to generate a gradient waveform has maximum start amplitude and maximum end amplitude, which might be benefit to minimize the lenghth of the gradient waveform so to minimize the off-resonance artifacts. However, based on our test, doing so takes minor effect. We still permit user to achieve "Maximized G0/G1" through global flags.

We drop out `g_FixGEnd` and `setExGEnd()`, but add `gMrTraj_gNorm0` and `gMrTraj_gNorm1` to let user control the end amplitude of the generated gradient waveform, if they are zero we will extrapolate the gradient waveform to make them end up with zero.
